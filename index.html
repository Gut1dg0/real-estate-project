                        <p>
                            Hello! I'm Tom Johnson, a professional and devoted Real Estate Agent.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        I have an impressive track record of delivering exceptional results for every client I serve. 
                        I understand every facet of the real estate business and extend that experience and market
                        knowledge to my clients, walking them through each stage of the process of buying or selling 
                        a home. My approach to closing deals, coupled with my extensive network of international
                        and domestic clients, from Los Angeles to Monaco, have enabled me rise to the top 1% of Realtors 
                        in a short period of time.

                    <p>
                        One of the biggest perks of working with a real estate agent is their ability to market your 
                        property to the right target audience. A professional agent with the right experience will 
                        be able to identify who will be interested in your property and implement effective strategies 
                        to reach them via their website, paid advertising, social media, and other means. When you work 
                        with an agent who has partnered with Luxury Presence, you benefit from the many different types 
                        of marketing capabilities the company offers. <span id="proof">Here is how:</span>

                            <p>
                                To reach your potential buyers, you have to know who they are, where they spend their time online, and how they 
                                make their buying decisions. Agents who use luxury real estate marketing services are able to identify your niche 
                                market, then create paid ads on Facebook, Google, Instagram, and YouTube that reach those interested in your property. 
                                These paid ad campaigns are highly customized and targeted, ensuring you are not spending money marketing to those who 
                                are not in the market for a property such as yours.

                            <p>
                                Content is one of the most powerful resources a real estate agent has to promote your property. Being able to create 
                                high-quality content such as video and copywriting is an essential tool that elevates the agents who use luxury real 
                                estate marketing services above their competitors. According to a recent survey, 85 percent of buyers and sellers want 
                                to work with an agent who uses video—and for good reason. An agent who uses video is able to connect with potential buyers 
                                on a deeper level and build trust and rapport. When they use video to market your property, they are showing viewers what 
                                it would really be like to walk through and live in your home—something that is much more difficult to do with a written description.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            However, written descriptions—or copywriting—is also important. Your property needs to be described in appealing and vibrant terms 
                            on the listing and on any additional marketing that is created to sell it. Those agents who work with Luxury Presence get access 
                            to experienced real estate copywriters who create blogs, website copy, and content marketing pieces that make your property attractive 
                            to potential buyers.

                            <p>
                                Recent research has shown that 44% of buyers found the home they purchased on the internet. Many of them simply googled the search terms 
                                that they wanted in a new home and started their search that way. For your home to show up in these types of searches, your real estate 
                                agent needs to use the right terms in your online marketing. The effective use of these terms is referred to as search engine optimization 
                                or SEO. The process of identifying and correctly using the right terms is a bit of a science—one that the SEO experts at Luxury Presence 
                                have mastered. When a potential buyer searches terms that match your home, your property will show up in the results and provide opportunities 
                                for the buyer to learn more.

                                If your real estate agent is an influencer on social media, he or she has access to thousands of niche buyers who are ready to invest in property. 
                                To be an influencer, an agent either needs to dedicate a large chunk of their time to social media or they need to partner with luxury real estate 
                                marketing service providers who can put in the work for them. Wouldn’t you rather your agent spent his or her time marketing your property and let 
                                an expert handle their social media presence? At Luxury Presence, our dedicated success team utilizes an agent’s stories and feed posts to help them 
                                go viral and become an authority in their industry. Once they’ve harnessed the power of becoming an influencer, they can use their voice to advocate 
                                for your home and sell it more quickly than their competitors.
